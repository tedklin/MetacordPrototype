<p>This occurs when the muscle wall on the left side of your heart is
enlarged or thickened. When a patient has high blood pressure or a heart
condition it causes the left side of you heart to work harder. The extra
work causes the wall muscles to thicken larger than they should. When
the wall muscle becomes too thick it will lose its elasticity and fail
to pump properly. Although you may be healthy this disease  will put you
at a higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke. If you have this
disease you may be experiencing: fatigue, shortness of breath, chest
pain after being active, quickened heartbeats or palpitations, and
dizziness.</p>
