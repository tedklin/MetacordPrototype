<p>When your blood vessels become blocked, plaque builds. The blood is supposed to 
transport oxygen to the organs in your body through these vessels. Without the needed 
oxygen, the tissue will become damaged or in extreme cases, die. Acute myocardial
infarction can be life-threatening. Chest pain is the most common symptom of a heart
attack but you may also experience: nausea, sweating, shortness of breath, vomiting, 
anxiety, dizziness, fast heart rate, coughing, and periodical pain in certain areas 
of the upper body such as the chest, jaw, and back. Patients with high blood pressure, 
high cholesterol and diabetes are at higher risk for this disease.</p>
