<p>Also known as left atrial enlargement, left atrial hypertrophy stems
from many heart problems. It can be acquired from material stenosis,
atrial regurgitation, left ventricular failure and left atrial myxoma.
You can obtain this disease if you have congenital diseases, including
ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus. The disease
occurs when the patient experiences tension due to increased filling
pressure in the atrial wall, eventually causing enlargement of the
atrial.</p>
